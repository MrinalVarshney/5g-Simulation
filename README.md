# 📡 Simulation of Packet Traversal in **4G/5G Networks**

> Multi-UPF Sliced Core • QoS Enforcement • Real Traffic Evaluation

This project demonstrates **packet traversal behaviour in 5G Standalone architecture using Open5GS + UERANSIM** with **multi-UPF routing, network slicing and QoS-controlled user-plane traffic.**

The work compares 4G/5G behaviour theoretically and performs **full 5G simulation**, analysing real packet traversal, throughput, latency & slice-based separation of data flows.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Simulate and analyse packet flow behaviour in 4G and 5G core networks
- Implement multi-UPF architecture with per-slice routing
- Validate slice-wise performance differences using real traffic
- Analyse control-plane & user-plane packet flow using Wireshark
- Evaluate QoS enforcement using MBR (Maximum Bit Rate) policies
